# HW to Chapters 2 “The Perceptron”

## 1. Describe the Perceptron and How It Works
The Perceptron is a type of artificial neural network used for binary classification tasks. It consists of input values, weights assigned to each input, a bias, a summation function, and an activation function. The Perceptron makes predictions by computing the weighted sum of its inputs and passing the result through an activation function, typically a step function, which outputs a binary result (e.g., 0 or 1).

The basic operation of the Perceptron involves the following steps:
1. Initialize weights and bias.
2. Compute the weighted sum of the inputs.
3. Apply the activation function to produce the output.
4. Update weights using an error correction rule during training.

## 2. What is Forward and Backpropagation for the Perceptron?
### Forward Propagation:
Forward propagation refers to the process where inputs are passed through the Perceptron model to compute the output. This involves multiplying the inputs by the respective weights, summing them, adding a bias term, and applying an activation function to determine the final output.

### Backpropagation:
Although the classical single-layer Perceptron does not use backpropagation, the concept is central to training multi-layer neural networks. Backpropagation is an algorithm used to minimize the error by adjusting the weights after each iteration. It calculates the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight, allowing the network to learn through supervised training.

## 3. What is the History of the Perceptron?
The Perceptron was first introduced in 1958 by Frank Rosenblatt. It was one of the earliest models of neural networks and inspired a wave of research in artificial intelligence and machine learning. The original Perceptron was designed to recognize patterns and could solve simple binary classification problems. However, due to its limitations in solving non-linearly separable problems, interest in the Perceptron waned until the development of multi-layer networks and backpropagation in the 1980s, which addressed these limitations.

## 4. What is Supervised Training?
Supervised training refers to the process of training a machine learning model using labeled data, where each training example is paired with its correct output. The Perceptron learns from this labeled data by adjusting its weights based on the errors in its predictions. Over time, the model improves its ability to make accurate predictions on new, unseen data.

In the context of the Perceptron, supervised training involves:
- Presenting the Perceptron with labeled input-output pairs.
- Computing the predicted output for each input.
- Comparing the predicted output to the correct output.
- Adjusting the weights to reduce the error.

## 5. Why is the Perceptron Referred to as a Binary Linear Classifier?
The Perceptron is referred to as a binary linear classifier because it classifies input data into two categories (binary classification) based on a linear decision boundary. The decision boundary is defined by the weights and bias learned during training. The Perceptron finds a linear hyperplane that separates the data points into two classes, making decisions based on whether a point lies above or below this hyperplane.

## 6. What are the Disadvantages of Binary Linear Classification?
The main disadvantages of binary linear classification, especially in the context of the Perceptron, include:
- **Inability to Solve Non-Linearly Separable Problems**: The Perceptron can only classify data that is linearly separable. It fails when the data points cannot be separated by a straight line (or hyperplane).
- **Limited Expressive Power**: The Perceptron cannot learn more complex decision boundaries that require non-linear separation.
- **Convergence Issues**: The Perceptron only converges if the data is linearly separable. If not, the training process may not lead to a useful solution.
