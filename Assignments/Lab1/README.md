# Lab 1 – Develop a Multilayer (Deep) Neural Network
Programming Assignment

Task 1: Develop a Multilayer Neural Network

Develop a multilayer (deep) neural networks for binary classification problem according to the following specification.

Model: (10/ReLU) – (8/ReLU)² – (4/ReLU) – (1/Sigmoid)
The specification above means the following:
layer 1 with 10 neurons and ReLU activation function
layers 2 and 3 (2 layers shown as power 2 in the spec) with 8 neurons per each layer and ReLU activation function
layer 4 with 4 neurons and ReLU activation function
one (last) layer 5 with one neuron and Sigmoid activation function
Task 2: Develop a training set

Choose objects to train the network and develop a training set

Task 3; GitHub

If you do not have your GitHub repository, then create it. If you are not clear how to do it, ask the TA.
Submission

Submit either

the link to the repository (if repository is public) or
the link to the repository and authorization (if repository is private)
to access your GitHub repository where the Lab 1 results (source code and results snapshots) are stored.
