# Non-programming Assignment

## 1. Describe the attention problem.
The attention problem refers to the challenge of determining which parts of the input data are most relevant when making a prediction or decision. In tasks like machine translation or speech recognition, models need to focus on specific segments of the input sequence to produce accurate outputs. Traditional models struggled with long-range dependencies and identifying relevant portions of data.

## 2. What is the attention model?
The attention model addresses the attention problem by assigning different weights to different parts of the input sequence based on their relevance to the current task. It computes a weighted combination of input elements, allowing the model to focus on the most important parts. Attention mechanisms are central to models like Transformers and significantly improve performance in NLP and other sequential tasks.

## 3. Describe the attention model for speech recognition.
In speech recognition, the attention model helps align audio inputs with textual outputs. It works as follows:
1. Encodes the input audio signal into feature representations.
2. Uses an attention mechanism to focus on specific parts of the audio relevant to generating each output token.
3. Decodes the aligned features into text using a recurrent or transformer-based model.
This process allows the model to handle variations in speech length and focus on important audio segments dynamically.

## 4. How does trigger word detection work?
Trigger word detection identifies specific keywords or phrases in an audio stream. It works by:
1. **Feature Extraction**: Converting audio signals into spectrograms or mel-frequency representations.
2. **Neural Network Processing**: Using a neural network (e.g., RNN or CNN) to learn patterns associated with the trigger word.
3. **Post-Processing**: Applying a sliding window or thresholding mechanism to detect trigger words in real time.
Trigger word detection is commonly used in voice assistants to recognize activation phrases like “Hey Siri” or “OK Google.”

## 5. What is the idea of transformers?
Transformers are a neural network architecture designed to process sequential data efficiently by using attention mechanisms. Unlike RNNs or LSTMs, transformers process all input elements in parallel, leveraging self-attention to capture dependencies between all parts of the sequence simultaneously. This design improves scalability and performance on tasks involving long sequences.

## 6. What is transformer architecture?
The transformer architecture consists of:
1. **Encoder-Decoder Structure**:
   - **Encoder**: Maps input sequences to a continuous representation.
   - **Decoder**: Generates the output sequence from the encoded representation.
2. **Self-Attention Mechanism**: Enables each token to focus on other relevant tokens in the sequence.
3. **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to the input embeddings to capture sequence order.
4. **Feedforward Layers**: Processes attention outputs through dense layers for additional transformations.
5. **Multi-Head Attention**: Employs multiple attention mechanisms to capture diverse relationships.

## 7. What is the LLM?
A Large Language Model (LLM) is a neural network trained on vast amounts of text data to perform a variety of language-related tasks. Examples include GPT, BERT, and PaLM. LLMs leverage transformer architecture and are capable of generating, understanding, and reasoning with human-like text across multiple domains.

## 8. What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to artificial intelligence systems designed to generate new content such as text, images, music, or videos. These models learn patterns from data and use them to produce creative outputs, often indistinguishable from human-generated content. Examples include GPT for text generation and DALL·E for image creation.

---

## 9. What are the core functionalities of Generative AI?
Core functionalities of Generative AI include:
1. **Text Generation**: Producing human-like text for chatbots, storytelling, or summarization.
2. **Image and Video Generation**: Creating realistic or artistic visuals.
3. **Speech Synthesis**: Generating lifelike speech from text.
4. **Data Augmentation**: Producing synthetic data to improve model training.
5. **Personalization**: Customizing outputs based on user preferences or context.

## 10. What is GPT and how does it work?
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a type of LLM based on the transformer architecture. It works as follows:
1. **Pre-training**: Trained on a large text corpus to predict the next word in a sequence (causal language modeling).
2. **Fine-tuning**: Optionally adapted to specific tasks or domains with labeled datasets.
3. **Inference**: Generates coherent and contextually relevant text by sampling from the learned probability distribution of words.

## 11. What is the concept of the Diffusion Network?
A Diffusion Network is a generative model that learns to create data by iteratively refining random noise into meaningful content. It works as follows:
1. **Forward Process**: Gradually adds noise to training data over multiple steps, creating a sequence of noisy versions.
2. **Reverse Process**: Trains a neural network to reverse this process, reconstructing the original data from noise.
Diffusion Networks are used in tasks like image generation and have achieved state-of-the-art results in producing high-quality visuals.
