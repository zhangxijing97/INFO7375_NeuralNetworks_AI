# HW to Chapter 10 “Normalization and Optimization Methods”

# Non-programming Assignment

## 1. What is normalization and why is it needed?
Normalization transforms the features of the dataset to a common scale, like [0, 1] or [-1, 1]. This process ensures that the different features contribute equally to improves the performance of machine learning algorithms.

Common Normalization Techniques:
Min-Max Scaling X' = (X - Xmin)/(Xmax - Xmin)

Original Data:
 [[1 2 3]
 [4 5 6]
 [7 8 9]]
Min-Max Scaled Data:
 [[0.  0.  0. ]
 [0.5 0.5 0.5]
 [1.  1.  1. ]]
