## Chapter 1: Human Brain and Neural Networks

### Python Environment
Create a virtual environment:
```
python -m venv env_name
```

Activate the virtual environment:
```
source env_name/bin/activate
```

Install required packages (if any):
```
pip install <package_name>
```

### Human Brain and Biological Neurons
The human brain is made up of billions of neurons, which are specialized cells that transmit information throughout the brain and body. These neurons communicate with each other through electrical and chemical signals, forming complex networks responsible for everything from movement to thought processes.

### Synapses and Neural Networks
Synapses are the junctions between neurons where signals are passed. Neural networks are a system of interconnected neurons, and they form the foundation for both biological systems and artificial neural networks used in computing.
