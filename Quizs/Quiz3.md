# Quiz 3

The "bias vs variance" problem in neural networks refers to the trade-off between two sources of error.

High bias occurs when the model is too simple, leading to underfitting and poor performance on both training and test data.

High variance happens when the model is too complex, capturing noise along with patterns, leading to overfitting and poor generalization to new data.
